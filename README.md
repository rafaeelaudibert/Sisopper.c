You can compile the aplication running `make`. This application was only tested on Linux (Ubuntu and Deepin).
Also, `<ncurses.h>` is required to compile this project.

### Running the server

The server can be run with `bin/server` and will listen in the port `4000`

### Running the client

A client can be run with `bin/client @handle` which will automatically connect to the `server` running on port `4000`
